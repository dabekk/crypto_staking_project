# crypto_staking_project

## TLDR;

## What is yield farming?

Yield farming, also referred to as liquidity mining, is a way to generate rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. In simple terms, it means putting your crypto into a liquidity pool for others to borrow and receiving a reward for it.

## What does this project do?
This project creates 2 cyrptocurrency tokens - mDai token (to mock DAI tokens) and a Dapp token (decetralized app token). It then allows investors (one investor in this case) to stake their mDai tokens and be rewarded by receiving staking rewards in the form of Dapp tokens. This is to simulate the concept of yield farming where investors stake cryptocurrency to receive staking rewards.
